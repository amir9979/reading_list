While existing studies achieve high accuracy with patient-specific\napproaches, they face difficulties in generalizing to new patients. To address\nthis, we propose a detection framework combining domain adversarial training\nwith a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bidirectional long short-term\nmemory (BiLSTM). First, the CNN extracts local patient-invariant features\nthrough domain adversarial training, which optimizes seizure detection accuracy\nwhile minimizing patient-specific characteristics. Then, the BiLSTM captures\ntemporal dependencies in the extracted features to model seizure evolution\npatterns. Evaluation using EEG recordings from 20 patients with focal epilepsy\ndemonstrated superior performance over non-adversarial methods, achieving high\ndetection accuracy across different patients. The integration of adversarial\ntraining with temporal modeling enables robust cross-patient seizure detection.", "comment": "6 pages, 4 figures, accepted at IEEE EMBC 2025", "journal_ref": null, "primary_category": "eess.SP", "categories": "eess.SP;cs.LG", "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15203v1;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15203v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15203v1"}]
