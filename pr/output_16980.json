Manual EEG review remains the clinical standard,\nunderscoring the need for robust models and standardized evaluation. To\nrigorously assess algorithm performance, we organized a challenge using a\nprivate dataset of continuous EEG recordings from 65 subjects (4,360 hours).\nExpert neurophysiologists annotated the data, providing ground truth for\nseizure events. Participants were required to detect seizure onset and\nduration, with evaluation based on event-based metrics, including sensitivity,\nprecision, F1-score, and false positives per day. The SzCORE framework ensured\nstandardized evaluation. The primary ranking criterion was the event-based\nF1-score, reflecting clinical relevance by balancing sensitivity and false\npositives. The challenge received 30 submissions from 19 teams, with 28\nalgorithms evaluated. Results revealed wide variability in performance, with a\ntop F1-score of 43% (sensitivity 37%, precision 45%), highlighting the ongoing\ndifficulty of seizure detection. The challenge also revealed a gap between\nreported performance and real-world evaluation, emphasizing the importance of\nrigorous benchmarking. Compared to previous challenges and commercial systems,\nthe best-performing algorithm in this contest showed improved performance.\nImportantly, the challenge platform now supports continuous benchmarking,\nenabling reproducible research, integration of new datasets, and clinical\nevaluation of seizure detection algorithms using a standardized framework.", "comment": null, "journal_ref": null, "primary_category": "eess.SP", "categories": "eess.SP;cs.AI;cs.LG;cs.PF", "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18191v1;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18191v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18191v1"}, {"title": "Unlocking German Clinical Text Data: Advanced De-Identification for LLM Training", "link": "https://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/volltextserver/36594/7/Spring_Symposium_MI_2025.pdf%23page%3D43", "details": "M Seiferling, C Lohrb, C Dietericha - 3rd Heidelberg Spring Symposium Medical Informatics", "abstract": "The Medical Informatics Initiative (MII)[1] represents the most comprehensive research program in Germany aimed at integrating clinical patient data across multiple institutions.
