However, training models for specific new tasks often requires\nlarge amounts of labeled data, which is difficult to obtain due to high\nannotation costs and data privacy concerns. To circumvent this issue, we\nintroduce MRI-CORE (MRI COmprehensive Representation Encoder), a vision\nfoundation model pre-trained using more than 6 million slices from over 110,000\nMRI volumes across 18 main body locations. Experiments on five diverse object\nsegmentation tasks in MRI demonstrate that MRI-CORE can significantly improve\nsegmentation performance in realistic scenarios with limited labeled data\navailability, achieving an average gain of 6.97% 3D Dice Coefficient using only\n10 annotated slices per task. We further demonstrate new model capabilities in\nMRI such as classification of image properties including body location,\nsequence type and institution, and zero-shot segmentation. These results\nhighlight the value of MRI-CORE as a generalist vision foundation model for\nMRI, potentially lowering the data annotation resource barriers for many\napplications.", "comment": "19 pages, 5 figures", "journal_ref": null, "primary_category": "eess.IV", "categories": "eess.IV;cs.AI;cs.CV;cs.LG", "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12186v1;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12186v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12186v1"}]
