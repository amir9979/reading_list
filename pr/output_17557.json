Although recent deep learning-based\nmethods have shown promising performance in MRI reconstruction, most require\nfully-sampled images for supervised learning, which is challenging in practice\nconsidering long acquisition times under respiratory or organ motion. Moreover,\nnearly all fully-sampled datasets are obtained from conventional reconstruction\nof mildly accelerated datasets, thus potentially biasing the achievable\nperformance. The numerous undersampled datasets with different accelerations in\nclinical practice, hence, remain underutilized. To address these issues, we\nfirst train a self-supervised feature extractor on undersampled images to learn\nsampling-insensitive features. The pre-learned features are subsequently\nembedded in the self-supervised reconstruction network to assist in removing\nartifacts. Experiments were conducted retrospectively on an in-house 2D cardiac\nCine dataset, including 91 cardiovascular patients and 38 healthy subjects. The\nresults demonstrate that the proposed SSFL-Recon framework outperforms existing\nself-supervised MRI reconstruction methods and even exhibits comparable or\nbetter performance to supervised learning up to $16\\times$ retrospective\nundersampling. The feature learning strategy can effectively extract global\nrepresentations, which have proven beneficial in removing artifacts and\nincreasing generalization ability during reconstruction.", "comment": "Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging (TMI), 2025", "journal_ref": null, "primary_category": "eess.IV", "categories": "eess.IV", "links": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2025.3570226;http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23408v1;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23408v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23408v1"}]
