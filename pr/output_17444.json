Electronic health records (EHRs), particularly those from\nintensive care units (ICUs), contain rich temporal clinical data that can be\nleveraged for this purpose. In this work, we introduce ICU-TSB (Temporal\nStratification Benchmark), the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating\npatient stratification based on temporal patient representation learning using\nthree publicly available ICU EHR datasets. A key contribution of our benchmark\nis a novel hierarchical evaluation framework utilizing disease taxonomies to\nmeasure the alignment of discovered clusters with clinically validated disease\ngroupings. In our experiments with ICU-TSB, we compared statistical methods and\nseveral recurrent neural networks, including LSTM and GRU, for their ability to\ngenerate effective patient representations for subsequent clustering of patient\ntrajectories. Our results demonstrate that temporal representation learning can\nrediscover clinically meaningful patient cohorts; nevertheless, it remains a\nchallenging task, with v-measuring varying from up to 0.46 at the top level of\nthe taxonomy to up to 0.40 at the lowest level. To further enhance the\npractical utility of our findings, we also evaluate multiple strategies for\nassigning interpretable labels to the identified clusters.

Typical domain generalization approaches struggle in\nreal-world healthcare settings for two main reasons: (1) patient-specific\ndomain labels are typically unavailable, making domain discovery especially\ndifficult; (2) purely data-driven approaches overlook key clinical insights,\nleading to a gap in medical knowledge integration. To address these problems,\nwe leverage hierarchical medical ontologies like the ICD-9-CM hierarchy to\ngroup diseases into higher-level categories and discover more flexible latent\ndomains. In this paper, we introduce UdonCare, a hierarchy-guided framework\nthat iteratively prunes fine-grained domains, encodes these refined domains,\nand applies a Siamese-type inference mechanism to separate domain-related\nsignals from patient-level features. Experimental results on clinical datasets\n(MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) show that the proposed model achieves higher\nperformance compared to other domain generalization baselines when substantial\ndomain gaps presents, highlighting the untapped potential of medical knowledge\nfor enhancing domain generalization in practical healthcare applications.", "comment": null, "journal_ref": null, "primary_category": "cs.LG", "categories": "cs.LG;cs.AI", "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06977v1;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06977v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06977v1"}, {"title": "Evaluating the SWIFT algorithm's efficacy in predicting hypoxemia across multiple critical care datasets", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883944125001108", "details": "L Schmidt, L Pigat, S Sheikhalishahi, J Sander\u2026 - Journal of Critical Care, 2025", "abstract": "Background Machine learning models to predict hypoxia in patients could improve timely interventions.
