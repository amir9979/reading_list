To address this, we introduce SANSKRITI, a benchmark designed to\nevaluate language models' comprehension of India's rich cultural diversity.\nComprising 21,853 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 28 states\nand 8 union territories, SANSKRITI is the largest dataset for testing Indian\ncultural knowledge. It covers sixteen key attributes of Indian culture: rituals\nand ceremonies, history, tourism, cuisine, dance and music, costume, language,\nart, festivals, religion, medicine, transport, sports, nightlife, and\npersonalities, providing a comprehensive representation of India's cultural\ntapestry. We evaluate SANSKRITI on leading Large Language Models (LLMs), Indic\nLanguage Models (ILMs), and Small Language Models (SLMs), revealing significant\ndisparities in their ability to handle culturally nuanced queries, with many\nmodels struggling in region-specific contexts. By offering an extensive,\nculturally rich, and diverse dataset, SANSKRITI sets a new standard for\nassessing and improving the cultural understanding of LMs.", "comment": "ACL 2025 Findings", "journal_ref": null, "primary_category": "cs.CL", "categories": "cs.CL", "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15355v1;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15355v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15355v1"}, {"title": "A Dataset of **Medical Questions** Paired with Automatically Generated **Answers** and Evidence-supported References", "link": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05233-z", "details": "D Gupta, D Bartels, D Demner-Fushman - Scientific Data, 2025", "abstract": "\u2026 New **Large** **Language** **Models** (LLM)-based approaches to **medical** **Question** **Answering** show unprecedented improvements in the fluency, grammaticality, and other qualities of the generated **answers**.
