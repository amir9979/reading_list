However,\nexisting models struggle with the challenges of real-world clinical practice as\nthey oversimplify patient profiles, rely on rigid input schemas, and are\nsensitive to distribution shifts. We developed AdaCVD, an adaptable CVD risk\nprediction framework built on large language models extensively fine-tuned on\nover half a million participants from the UK Biobank. In benchmark comparisons,\nAdaCVD surpasses established risk scores and standard machine learning\napproaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Crucially, for the first\ntime, it addresses key clinical challenges across three dimensions: it flexibly\nincorporates comprehensive yet variable patient information; it seamlessly\nintegrates both structured data and unstructured text; and it rapidly adapts to\nnew patient populations using minimal additional data. In stratified analyses,\nit demonstrates robust performance across demographic, socioeconomic, and\nclinical subgroups, including underrepresented cohorts. AdaCVD offers a\npromising path toward more flexible, AI-driven clinical decision support tools\nsuited to the realities of heterogeneous and dynamic healthcare environments.", "comment": null, "journal_ref": null, "primary_category": "cs.AI", "categories": "cs.AI;cs.LG", "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24655v1;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24655v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24655v1"}]
