Zihad Bin Jahangir;Muhammad Ashad Kabir;Sumaiya Akter;Israt Jahan;Minh Chau", "summary": "Automated radiology report generation holds significant potential to reduce\nradiologists' workload and enhance diagnostic accuracy. However, generating\nprecise and clinically meaningful reports from chest radiographs remains\nchallenging due to the complexity of medical language and the need for\ncontextual understanding. Existing models often struggle with maintaining both\naccuracy and contextual relevance. In this paper, we present LLaMA-XR, a novel\nframework that integrates LLaMA 3.1 with DenseNet-121-based image embeddings\nand Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) fine-tuning. LLaMA-XR achieves\nimproved coherence and clinical accuracy while maintaining computational\nefficiency. This efficiency is driven by an optimization strategy that enhances\nparameter utilization and reduces memory overhead, enabling faster report\ngeneration with lower computational resource demands. Extensive experiments\nconducted on the IU X-ray benchmark dataset demonstrate that LLaMA-XR\noutperforms a range of state-of-the-art methods. Our model achieves a ROUGE-L\nscore of 0.433 and a METEOR score of 0.336, establishing new performance\nbenchmarks in the domain. These results underscore LLaMA-XR's potential as an\neffective and efficient AI system for automated radiology reporting, offering\nenhanced clinical utility and reliability.", "comment": "25 pages", "journal_ref": null, "primary_category": "eess.IV", "categories": "eess.IV;cs.AI;cs.CV", "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03178v1;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03178v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03178v1"}, {"title": "Toward general text-guided multimodal brain MRI synthesis for diagnosis and medical image analysis", "link": "https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791\\(25\\)00255-1", "details": "Y Wang, H Xiong, K Sun, S Bai, L Dai, Z Ding, J Liu\u2026 - Cell Reports Medicine, 2025", "abstract": "Multimodal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers complementary insights into brain structure and function, thereby improving the diagnostic accuracy of neurological disorders and advancing brain-related research.

It tackles challenges in open\nlong-tailed lung disease classification and enhances the measurability of\nstate-of-the-art techniques. The first event, CXR-LT 2023, aimed to achieve\nthese goals by providing high-quality benchmark CXR data for model development\nand conducting comprehensive evaluations to identify ongoing issues impacting\nlung disease classification performance. Building on the success of CXR-LT\n2023, the CXR-LT 2024 expands the dataset to 377,110 chest X-rays (CXRs) and 45\ndisease labels, including 19 new rare disease findings. It also introduces a\nnew focus on zero-shot learning to address limitations identified in the\nprevious event. Specifically, CXR-LT 2024 features three tasks: (i) long-tailed\nclassification on a large, noisy test set, (ii) long-tailed classification on a\nmanually annotated \"gold standard\" subset, and (iii) zero-shot generalization\nto five previously unseen disease findings. This paper provides an overview of\nCXR-LT 2024, detailing the data curation process and consolidating\nstate-of-the-art solutions, including the use of multimodal models for rare\ndisease detection, advanced generative approaches to handle noisy labels, and\nzero-shot learning strategies for unseen diseases. Additionally, the expanded\ndataset enhances disease coverage to better represent real-world clinical\nsettings, offering a valuable resource for future research.
