With MedPerturb, we release a dataset of 800 clinical contexts\ngrounded in realistic input variability, outputs from four LLMs, and three\nhuman expert reads per clinical context. We use MedPerturb in two case studies\nto reveal how shifts in gender identity cues, language style, or format reflect\ndiverging treatment selections between humans and LLMs. We find that LLMs are\nmore sensitive to gender and style perturbations while human annotators are\nmore sensitive to LLM-generated format perturbations such as clinical\nsummaries. Our results highlight the need for evaluation frameworks that go\nbeyond static benchmarks to assess the similarity between human clinician and\nLLM decisions under the variability characteristic of clinical settings.", "comment": null, "journal_ref": null, "primary_category": "cs.AI", "categories": "cs.AI", "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17163v1;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17163v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17163v1"}, {"title": "Management of hidradenitis suppurativa in UK primary care: cross-sectional survey", "link": "https://bjgpopen.org/content/bjgpoa/early/2025/06/22/BJGPO.2025.0060.full.pdf", "details": "HE Wainman, S Gallard, MJ Ridd, JR Ingram - BJGP Open, 2025", "abstract": "Background Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a painful, chronic, inflammatory skin condition affecting the skin folds.
