While recent large language model\n(LLM)-based methods pre-trained on general clinical corpora show promise in\nclinical text generation, they fall short in producing long-form notes from\nlimited patient information. In this paper, we propose R2AG, the first\nreinforced retriever for long-form discharge instruction generation based on\npre-admission data. R2AG is trained with reinforcement learning to retrieve\nreasoning paths from a medical knowledge graph, providing explicit semantic\nguidance to the LLM. To bridge the information gap, we propose Group-Based\nRetriever Optimization (GRO) which improves retrieval quality with\ngroup-relative rewards, encouraging reasoning leaps for deeper inference by the\nLLM. Comprehensive experiments on the MIMIC-IV-Note dataset show that R2AG\noutperforms baselines in both clinical efficacy and natural language generation\nmetrics. Further analysis reveals that R2AG fills semantic gaps in sparse input\nscenarios, and retrieved reasoning paths help LLMs avoid clinical\nmisinterpretation by focusing on key evidence and following coherent reasoning.", "comment": null, "journal_ref": null, "primary_category": "cs.CL", "categories": "cs.CL;cs.AI", "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05386v1;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05386v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05386v1"}]
