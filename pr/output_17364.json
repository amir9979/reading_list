Existing approaches\noften focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the\ncomplex, longitudinal interactions needed for a holistic understanding of\npatient health. In this work, we propose a novel approach to patient pathway\nmodeling by transforming diverse electronic health record (EHR) data into a\nstructured representation and designing a holistic pathway prediction model,\nEHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we\nintroduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into\ntopic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models,\nwhile being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance\nin both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming\ncompetitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories,\ninherently targeting diverse evaluation tasks, such as forecasting vital signs,\nlab test results, or length-of-stay, opening a path towards predictive and\npersonalized healthcare.", "comment": null, "journal_ref": null, "primary_category": "cs.LG", "categories": "cs.LG;cs.CL", "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04831v1;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04831v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04831v1"}, {"title": "Clinical Information Extraction with Large Language Models: A Case Study on Organ Procurement", "link": "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12099322/", "details": "H Adam, J Lin, J Lin, H Keenan, A Wilson, M Ghassemi - AMIA Annual Symposium \u2026, 2025", "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools for clinical information extraction from unstructured text.
