However, their\nreliability in high-stakes domains such as medicine, particularly in\nlow-resource languages, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce\nPersianMedQA, a large-scale, expert-validated dataset of multiple-choice\nPersian medical questions, designed to evaluate LLMs across both Persian and\nEnglish. We benchmark over 40 state-of-the-art models, including\ngeneral-purpose, Persian fine-tuned, and medical LLMs, in zero-shot and\nchain-of-thought (CoT) settings. Our results show that closed-source general\nmodels (e.g., GPT-4.1) consistently outperform all other categories, achieving\n83.3% accuracy in Persian and 80.7% in English, while Persian fine-tuned models\nsuch as Dorna underperform significantly (e.g., 35.9% in Persian), often\nstruggling with both instruction-following and domain reasoning. We also\nanalyze the impact of translation, showing that while English performance is\ngenerally higher, Persian responses are sometimes more accurate due to cultural\nand clinical contextual cues. Finally, we demonstrate that model size alone is\ninsufficient for robust performance without strong domain or language\nadaptation. PersianMedQA provides a foundation for evaluating multilingual and\nculturally grounded medical reasoning in LLMs. The PersianMedQA dataset can be\naccessed at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/MohammadJRanjbar/PersianMedQA", "comment": null, "journal_ref": null, "primary_category": "cs.CL", "categories": "cs.CL;cs.IT;math.IT", "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00250v2;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.00250v2", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.00250v2"}, {"title": "Comparing Text-Based Clinical Risk Prediction in Critical Care: A Note-Specific Hierarchical Network and Large Language Models", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel8/6221020/6363502/11016178.pdf", "details": "J Liu, A Nguyen, D Capurro, K Verspoor - IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health \u2026, 2025", "abstract": "Clinical predictive analysis is a crucial task with numerous applications and has been extensively studied using machine learning approaches.
