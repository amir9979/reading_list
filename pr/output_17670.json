Various\nevaluation metrics have been discussed in the literature to solve this problem.\nMost of the existing metrics (e.g., precision, recall) are adapted from\nclassification tasks which require manual labels as ground truth. However, such\nlabels are often expensive and unavailable in specific thematic domains.\nFurthermore, medical images are usually associated with (radiological) case\nreports or annotated with descriptive captions in literature figures, such text\ncontains information that can help to assess CBIR.Several researchers have\nargued that the medical concepts hidden in the text can serve as the basis for\nCBIR evaluation purpose. However, these works often consider these medical\nconcepts as independent and isolated labels while in fact the subtle\nrelationships between various concepts are neglected. In this work, we\nintroduce the use of knowledge graphs to measure the distance between various\nmedical concepts and propose a novel relevance measure for the evaluation of\nCBIR by defining an approximate matching-based relevance score between two sets\nof medical concepts which allows us to indirectly measure the similarity\nbetween medical images.We quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness and\nfeasibility of our relevance measure using a public dataset.", "comment": "This paper has been accepted by the International Conference on Image\n  Analysis and Processing 2025", "journal_ref": null, "primary_category": "cs.CV", "categories": "cs.CV", "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13509v1;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13509v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13509v1"}, {"title": "Enhancing Clinical Models with Pseudo Data for De-identification", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12674", "details": "P Landes, AJ Chaise, TN Nandi, RK Madduri - arXiv preprint arXiv:2506.12674, 2025", "abstract": "Many models are pretrained on redacted text for privacy reasons.
