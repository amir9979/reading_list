The ``black-box'' nature of these models\nmakes it difficult for clinicians to understand the reasoning behind\npredictions, limiting their ability to make informed decisions. Additionally,\nthe absence of interactive mechanisms prevents clinicians from incorporating\ntheir own knowledge and experience into the decision-making process. To address\nthese limitations, we propose II-KEA, a knowledge-enhanced agent-driven causal\ndiscovery framework that integrates personalized knowledge databases and\nagentic LLMs. II-KEA enhances interpretability through explicit reasoning and\ncausal analysis, while also improving interactivity by allowing clinicians to\ninject their knowledge and experience through customized knowledge bases and\nprompts. II-KEA is evaluated on both MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, demonstrating\nsuperior performance along with enhanced interpretability and interactivity, as\nevidenced by its strong results from extensive case studies.", "comment": null, "journal_ref": null, "primary_category": "cs.AI", "categories": "cs.AI", "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16288v1;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16288v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16288v1"}]
