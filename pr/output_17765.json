Despite the progress, their practical\ndeployment is severely constrained by inference speed bottlenecks, particularly\nin high-frequency and dexterous manipulation tasks. While recent studies have\nexplored Jacobi decoding as a more efficient alternative to traditional\nautoregressive decoding, its practical benefits are marginal due to the lengthy\niterations. To address it, we introduce consistency distillation training to\npredict multiple correct action tokens in each iteration, thereby achieving\nacceleration. Besides, we design mixed-label supervision to mitigate the error\naccumulation during distillation. Although distillation brings acceptable\nspeedup, we identify that certain inefficient iterations remain a critical\nbottleneck. To tackle this, we propose an early-exit decoding strategy that\nmoderately relaxes convergence conditions, which further improves average\ninference efficiency. Experimental results show that the proposed method\nachieves more than 4 times inference acceleration across different baselines\nwhile maintaining high task success rates in both simulated and real-world\nrobot tasks. These experiments validate that our approach provides an efficient\nand general paradigm for accelerating multimodal decision-making in robotics.\nOur project page is available at https://irpn-eai.github.io/CEED-VLA/.", "comment": "16 pages", "journal_ref": null, "primary_category": "cs.RO", "categories": "cs.RO", "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13725v1;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13725v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13725v1"}]
