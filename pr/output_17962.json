However, effectively\nintegrating these high-dimensional temporal signals with natural language for\ndynamic, interactive tasks remains a significant challenge. To address this, we\nintroduce the Time-Series Question Answering (Time-Series QA) task and release\nEngineMT-QA, the first large-scale, multi-task, temporal-textual QA dataset\ndesigned to capture complex interactions between time-series signals and\nnatural language. Building on this resource, we propose the Instruct Time\nTransformer (ITFormer), a novel framework that bridges time-series encoders\nwith frozen large language models (LLMs). ITFormer effectively extracts,\naligns, and fuses temporal and textual features, achieving a strong improvement\nin QA accuracy over strong baselines with fewer than 1\\% additional trainable\nparameters. By combining computational efficiency with robust cross-modal\nmodeling, our work establishes a adaptable paradigm for integrating temporal\ndata with natural language, paving the way for new research and applications in\nmulti-modal AI.
