Materials and Methods: The pipeline extracts ROS sections using\nSecTag, followed by few-shot LLMs to identify ROS entity spans, their\npositive/negative status, and associated body systems. We implemented the\npipeline using open-source LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Gemma) and ChatGPT. The\nevaluation was conducted on 36 general medicine notes containing 341 annotated\nROS entities. Results: When integrating ChatGPT, the pipeline achieved the\nlowest error rates in detecting ROS entity spans and their corresponding\nstatuses/systems (28.2% and 14.5%, respectively). Open-source LLMs enable\nlocal, cost-efficient execution of the pipeline while delivering promising\nperformance with similarly low error rates (span: 30.5-36.7%; status/system:\n24.3-27.3%). Discussion and Conclusion: Our pipeline offers a scalable and\nlocally deployable solution to reduce ROS documentation burden. Open-source\nLLMs present a viable alternative to commercial models in resource-limited\nhealthcare environments.", "comment": null, "journal_ref": null, "primary_category": "cs.CL", "categories": "cs.CL", "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11067v1;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11067v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.11067v1"}, {"title": "4| GO TRAIN: A Protocol for Metadata Creation for the FAIRification of Patient Data Health Records", "link": "https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/358/edited_volume/chapter/4176577", "details": "M Mawere, L Maxwell, SY Amare, MV Reisen - Fair Data Fair Africa Fair World, 2025", "abstract": ""}]
