We analyzed 30862\ncatheter episodes at University Hospitals Leuven (2012-2013) to predict 7-day\nCLABSI risk using a landmark cause-specific supermodel, accounting for\ncompeting risks of hospital discharge and death. Imputation methods included\nsimple methods (median/mode, last observation carried forward), multiple\nimputation, regression-based and mixed-effects models leveraging longitudinal\nstructure, and random forest imputation to capture interactions and\nnon-linearities. Missing indicators were also assessed alone and in combination\nwith other imputation methods. Model performance was evaluated dynamically at\ndaily landmarks up to 14 days post-catheter placement. The missing indicator\napproach showed the highest discriminative ability, achieving a mean AUROC of\nup to 0.782 and superior overall performance based on the scaled Brier score.\nCombining missing indicators with other methods slightly improved performance,\nwith the mixed model approach combined with missing indicators achieving the\nhighest AUROC (0.783) at day 4, and the missForestPredict approach combined\nwith missing indicators yielding the best scaled Brier scores at earlier\nlandmarks. This suggests that in EHR data, the presence or absence of\ninformation may hold valuable insights for patient risk prediction. However,\nthe use of missing indicators requires caution, as shifts in EHR data over time\ncan alter missing data patterns, potentially impacting model transportability.", "comment": "arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.01986", "journal_ref": null, "primary_category": "stat.AP", "categories": "stat.AP", "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06707v1;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06707v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06707v1"}, {"title": "Assessment and Integration of Large Language Models for Automated Electronic Health Record Documentation in Emergency Medical Services", "link": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10916-025-02197-w", "details": "E Bai, X Luo, Z Zhang, K Adelgais, H Ali, J Finkelstein\u2026 - Journal of Medical Systems, 2025", "abstract": "Abstract Automating Electronic Health Records (EHR) documentation can significantly reduce the burden on care providers, particularly in emergency care settings where rapid and accurate record-keeping is crucial.
