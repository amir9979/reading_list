Although\nthese modalities appear disparate, many encode convergent information about a\nsingle underlying physiological state. The Latent Space Hypothesis frames each\nobservation as a projection of a unified, hierarchically organized manifold --\nmuch like shadows cast by the same three-dimensional object. Within this\nlearned geometric representation, an individual's health status occupies a\npoint, disease progression traces a trajectory, and therapeutic intervention\ncorresponds to a directed vector. Interpreting heterogeneous evidence in a\nshared space provides a principled way to re-examine eponymous conditions --\nsuch as Parkinson's or Crohn's -- that often mask multiple pathophysiological\nentities and involve broader anatomical domains than once believed. By\nrevealing sub-trajectories and patient-specific directions of change, the\nframework supplies a quantitative rationale for personalised diagnosis,\nlongitudinal monitoring, and tailored treatment, moving clinical practice away\nfrom grouping by potentially misleading labels toward navigation of each\nperson's unique trajectory. Challenges remain -- bias amplification, data\nscarcity for rare disorders, privacy, and the correlation-causation divide --\nbut scale-aware encoders, continual learning on longitudinal data streams, and\nperturbation-based validation offer plausible paths forward.", "comment": "51 pages, 12 figures.
