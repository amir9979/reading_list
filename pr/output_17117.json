This\nstudy introduces a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based Large Language\nModel (LLM) framework designed to support policymakers by extracting relevant\nlegal content and generating accurate, inquiry-specific responses. The\nframework focuses on reducing hallucinations in LLMs by using a curated set of\ndomain-specific questions to guide response generation. By incorporating\nretrieval mechanisms, the system enhances the factual grounding and specificity\nof its outputs. Our analysis shows that the proposed RAG-based LLM outperforms\nleading commercial LLMs across four evaluation metrics: AlignScore, ParaScore,\nBERTScore, and ROUGE, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing reliable and\ncontext-aware legal insights. This approach offers a scalable, AI-driven method\nfor legislative analysis, supporting efforts to update legal frameworks in line\nwith advancements in transportation technologies.", "comment": "Presented at the Transportation Research Board (TRB) Annual Meeting\n  2025, and subsequently submitted for publication consideration in the\n  Transportation Research Record (TRR)", "journal_ref": null, "primary_category": "cs.CL", "categories": "cs.CL;cs.AI", "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18426v1;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18426v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18426v1"}, {"title": "KERL: Knowledge-Enhanced Personalized Recipe Recommendation using Large Language Models", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14629", "details": "F Mohbat, MJ Zaki - arXiv preprint arXiv:2505.14629, 2025", "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and the abundance of food data have resulted in studies to improve food understanding using LLMs. Despite several recommendation systems utilizing LLMs and Knowledge Graphs (KGs), there has \u2026", "entry_id": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14629v1", "updated": "2025-05-20 17:19:57", "published": "2025-05-20 17:19:57", "authors": "Fnu Mohbat;Mohammed J Zaki", "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and the abundance of food\ndata have resulted in studies to improve food understanding using LLMs. Despite\nseveral recommendation systems utilizing LLMs and Knowledge Graphs (KGs), there\nhas been limited research on integrating food related KGs with LLMs. We\nintroduce KERL, a unified system that leverages food KGs and LLMs to provide\npersonalized food recommendations and generates recipes with associated\nmicro-nutritional information. Given a natural language question, KERL extracts\nentities, retrieves subgraphs from the KG, which are then fed into the LLM as\ncontext to select the recipes that satisfy the constraints. Next, our system\ngenerates the cooking steps and nutritional information for each recipe. To\nevaluate our approach, we also develop a benchmark dataset by curating recipe\nrelated questions, combined with constraints and personal preferences. Through\nextensive experiments, we show that our proposed KG-augmented LLM significantly\noutperforms existing approaches, offering a complete and coherent solution for\nfood recommendation, recipe generation, and nutritional analysis.
