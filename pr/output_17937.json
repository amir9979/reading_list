This study evaluates models for phenotyping\nHF patients based on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) classes, using\nstructured and unstructured data, assessing performance and interpretability.\n  Materials and Methods: The study analyzes all HF hospitalizations at both\nAmsterdam UMC hospitals (AMC and VUmc) from 2015 to 2023 (33,105\nhospitalizations, 16,334 patients). Data from AMC were used for model training,\nand from VUmc for external validation. The dataset was unlabelled and included\ntabular clinical measurements and discharge letters. Silver labels for LVEF\nclasses were generated by combining diagnosis codes, echocardiography results,\nand textual mentions. Gold labels were manually annotated for 300 patients for\ntesting. Multiple Transformer-based (black-box) and Aug-Linear (white-box)\nmodels were trained and compared with baselines on structured and unstructured\ndata. To evaluate interpretability, two clinicians annotated 20 discharge\nletters by highlighting information they considered relevant for LVEF\nclassification. These were compared to SHAP and LIME explanations from\nblack-box models and the inherent explanations of Aug-Linear models.\n  Results: BERT-based and Aug-Linear models, using discharge letters alone,\nachieved the highest classification results (AUC=0.84 for BERT, 0.81 for\nAug-Linear on external validation), outperforming baselines. Aug-Linear\nexplanations aligned more closely with clinicians' explanations than post-hoc\nexplanations on black-box models.\n  Conclusions: Discharge letters emerged as the most informative source for\nphenotyping HF patients. Aug-Linear models matched black-box performance while\nproviding clinician-aligned interpretability, supporting their use in\ntransparent clinical decision-making.", "comment": "43 pages, 8 figures", "journal_ref": null, "primary_category": "cs.CL", "categories": "cs.CL;cs.LG;68T50;I.2.7; J.3", "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24619v1;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24619v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24619v1"}]
