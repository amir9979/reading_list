We evaluated this\nrelationship using 2,400 real patient cases from the MIMIC-CDM dataset across\nfour abdominal pathologies (appendicitis, pancreatitis, cholecystitis,\ndiverticulitis), decomposing clinical diagnosis into information gathering,\ninterpretation, and differential diagnosis. We evaluated single agent systems\n(one model performing all tasks) against multi-agent systems (specialized\nmodels for each task) using comprehensive metrics spanning diagnostic outcomes,\nprocess adherence, and cost efficiency. Our results reveal a paradox: while\nmulti-agent systems generally outperformed single agents, the\ncomponent-optimized or Best of Breed system with superior components and\nexcellent process metrics (85.5% information accuracy) significantly\nunderperformed in diagnostic accuracy (67.7% vs. 77.4% for a top multi-agent\nsystem). This finding underscores that successful integration of AI in\nhealthcare requires not just component level optimization but also attention to\ninformation flow and compatibility between agents. Our findings highlight the\nneed for end to end system validation rather than relying on component metrics\nalone.", "comment": null, "journal_ref": null, "primary_category": "cs.AI", "categories": "cs.AI;cs.MA", "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06574v2;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06574v2", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06574v2"}, {"title": "From Tool to Teammate: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Clinician-AI Collaborative Workflows for Diagnosis", "link": "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2025/06/08/2025.06.07.25329176.full.pdf", "details": "SS Everett, BJ Bunning, P Jain, I Lopez, A Agarwal\u2026 - medRxiv, 2025", "abstract": "Early studies of large language models (LLMs) in clinical settings have largely treated artificial intelligence (AI) as a tool rather than an active collaborator.

Clinical data used to support these decisions are often irregularly\nsampled, sparse, and noisy. Existing decision support systems commonly rely on\ndiscretization and imputation, which can distort critical temporal dynamics and\ndegrade decision quality. Moreover, they often overlook the clinical\nsignificance of irregular recording frequencies, filtering out patterns in how\nand when data is collected. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a natural fit for\nclinical decision-making, enabling sequential, long-term optimization in\ndynamic, uncertain environments. However, most existing treatment\nrecommendation systems are model-free and trained solely on offline data,\nmaking them sample-inefficient, sensitive to data quality, and poorly\ngeneralizable across tasks or cohorts. To address these limitations, we propose\nMedDreamer, a two-phase model-based RL framework for personalized treatment\nrecommendation. MedDreamer uses a world model with an Adaptive Feature\nIntegration (AFI) module to effectively model irregular, sparse clinical data.\nThrough latent imagination, it simulates plausible patient trajectories to\nenhance learning, refining its policy using a mix of real and imagined\nexperiences. This enables learning policies that go beyond suboptimal\nhistorical decisions while remaining grounded in clinical data. To our\nknowledge, this is the first application of latent imagination to irregular\nhealthcare data. Evaluations on sepsis and mechanical ventilation (MV)\ntreatment using two large-scale EHR datasets show that MedDreamer outperforms\nboth model-free and model-based baselines in clinical outcomes and off-policy\nmetrics.", "comment": null, "journal_ref": null, "primary_category": "cs.LG", "categories": "cs.LG;cs.AI", "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19785v1;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19785v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19785v1"}, {"title": "Clinical Information Extraction with Large Language Models: A Case Study on Organ Procurement", "link": "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12099322/", "details": "H Adam, J Lin, J Lin, H Keenan, A Wilson, M Ghassemi - AMIA Annual Symposium \u2026, 2025", "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools for clinical information extraction from unstructured text.
