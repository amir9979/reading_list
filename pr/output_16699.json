However, unlike domains such as math or coding, where\ncorrectness can be objectively defined by the final answer, medical diagnosis\nrequires both the outcome and the reasoning process to be accurate. Currently,\nwidely used medical benchmarks like MedQA and MMLU assess only accuracy in the\nfinal answer, overlooking the quality and faithfulness of the clinical\nreasoning process. To address this limitation, we introduce MedCaseReasoning,\nthe first open-access dataset for evaluating LLMs on their ability to align\nwith clinician-authored diagnostic reasoning. The dataset includes 14,489\ndiagnostic question-and-answer cases, each paired with detailed reasoning\nstatements derived from open-access medical case reports. We evaluate\nstate-of-the-art reasoning LLMs on MedCaseReasoning and find significant\nshortcomings in their diagnoses and reasoning: for instance, the top-performing\nopen-source model, DeepSeek-R1, achieves only 48% 10-shot diagnostic accuracy\nand mentions only 64% of the clinician reasoning statements (recall). However,\nwe demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on the reasoning traces derived from\nMedCaseReasoning significantly improves diagnostic accuracy and clinical\nreasoning recall by an average relative gain of 29% and 41%, respectively. The\nopen-source dataset, code, and models are available at\nhttps://github.com/kevinwu23/Stanford-MedCaseReasoning.", "comment": null, "journal_ref": null, "primary_category": "cs.CL", "categories": "cs.CL", "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11733v2;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11733v2", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11733v2"}]
