However, an important yet\nunderexplored challenge is how to effectively finetune TSFMs on specific\ndownstream tasks. While naive finetuning can yield performance gains, we argue\nthat it falls short of fully leveraging TSFMs' capabilities, often resulting in\noverfitting and suboptimal performance. Given the diverse temporal patterns\nacross sampling scales and the inherent multi-scale forecasting capabilities of\nTSFMs, we adopt a causal perspective to analyze finetuning process, through\nwhich we highlight the critical importance of explicitly modeling multiple\nscales and reveal the shortcomings of naive approaches. Focusing on\n\\textit{encoder-based} TSFMs, we propose \\textbf{M}ulti\\textbf{\\textsc{s}}cale\n\\textbf{\\textsc{f}}ine\\textbf{\\textsc{t}}uning (\\textbf{MSFT}), a simple yet\ngeneral framework that explicitly integrates multi-scale modeling into the\nfinetuning process.
