Kamrul Hasan", "summary": "Background: Deep learning has significantly advanced ECG arrhythmia\nclassification, enabling high accuracy in detecting various cardiac conditions.\nThe use of single-lead ECG systems is crucial for portable devices, as they\noffer convenience and accessibility for continuous monitoring in diverse\nsettings. However, the interpretability and reliability of deep learning models\nin clinical applications poses challenges due to their black-box nature.\nMethods: To address these challenges, we propose EXGnet, a single-lead,\ntrustworthy ECG arrhythmia classification network that integrates\nmultiresolution feature extraction with Explainable Artificial Intelligence\n(XAI) guidance and train only quantitative features. Results: Trained on two\npublic datasets, including Chapman and Ningbo, EXGnet demonstrates superior\nperformance through key metrics such as Accuracy, F1-score, Sensitivity, and\nSpecificity. The proposed method achieved average five fold accuracy of\n98.762%, and 96.932% and average F1-score of 97.910%, and 95.527% on the\nChapman and Ningbo datasets, respectively. Conclusions: By employing XAI\ntechniques, specifically Grad-CAM, the model provides visual insights into the\nrelevant ECG segments it analyzes, thereby enhancing clinician trust in its\npredictions. While quantitative features further improve classification\nperformance, they are not required during testing, making the model suitable\nfor real-world applications. Overall, EXGnet not only achieves better\nclassification accuracy but also addresses the critical need for\ninterpretability in deep learning, facilitating broader adoption in portable\nECG monitoring.", "comment": "21 pages, 3 figures", "journal_ref": null, "primary_category": "cs.LG", "categories": "cs.LG;cs.AI", "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12404v1;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12404v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12404v1"}, {"title": "External validation of atrial fibrillation risk prediction tools in a racially diverse cohort of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients", "link": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1547527125025068", "details": "H Pronovost, AA Kassamali, J Ehmsen, B Rivers\u2026 - Heart Rhythm, 2025", "abstract": "Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).
