Large language models (LLMs) could\nsupport crisis assessments, yet their capabilities in emotionally sensitive\ncontexts remain unclear. We introduce PsyCrisisBench, a benchmark of 540\nannotated transcripts from the Hangzhou Psychological Assistance Hotline,\nassessing four tasks: mood status recognition, suicidal ideation detection,\nsuicide plan identification, and risk assessment. We evaluated 64 LLMs across\n15 families (e.g., GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama, Qwen, DeepSeek) using zero-shot,\nfew-shot, and fine-tuning paradigms. Performance was measured by F1-score, with\nstatistical comparisons via Welch's t-tests. LLMs performed strongly on\nsuicidal ideation detection (F1=0.880), suicide plan identification (F1=0.779),\nand risk assessment (F1=0.907), improved with few-shot and fine-tuning. Mood\nstatus recognition was more challenging (max F1=0.709), likely due to lost\nvocal cues and ambiguity. A fine-tuned 1.5B-parameter model (Qwen2.5-1.5B)\nsurpassed larger models on mood and suicidal ideation. Open-source models like\nQwQ-32B performed comparably to closed-source on most tasks (p>0.3), though\nclosed models retained an edge in mood detection (p=0.007). Performance scaled\nwith size up to a point; quantization (AWQ) reduced GPU memory by 70% with\nminimal F1 degradation. LLMs show substantial promise in structured\npsychological crisis assessments, especially with fine-tuning. Mood recognition\nremains limited due to contextual complexity. The narrowing gap between open-\nand closed-source models, combined with efficient quantization, suggests\nfeasible integration. PsyCrisisBench offers a robust evaluation framework to\nguide model development and ethical deployment in mental health.", "comment": "30 pages, 8 figures", "journal_ref": null, "primary_category": "cs.CL", "categories": "cs.CL;cs.AI", "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01329v1;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.01329v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.01329v1"}, {"title": "GO TRAIN: A protocol for metadata creation for the FAIRification of patient data health records", "link": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mirjam-Reisen/publication/391760684_GO_TRAIN_A_Protocol_for_Metadata_Creation_for_the_FAIRification_of_Patient_Data_Health_Records/links/683576b1d1054b0207f590b7/GO-TRAIN-A-Protocol-for-Metadata-Creation-for-the-FAIRification-of-Patient-Data-Health-Records.pdf", "details": "A Aktau, SY Amare, M Van Reisen, GT Taye\u2026 - FAIR data, FAIR Africa, FAIR \u2026, 2025", "abstract": "This research investigates the components required to create FAIR-compliant data architectures for patient health information systems.
