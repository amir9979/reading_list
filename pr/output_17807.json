While Large Language Models (LLMs)\noffer promise as tools to simulate such complex pedagogical environments,\ncurrent simulation frameworks are limited in two key respects: (1) they often\nreduce students to static knowledge profiles, and (2) they lack adaptive\nmechanisms for modeling teachers who evolve their strategies in response to\nstudent feedback. To address these gaps, \\textbf{we introduce a novel\nsimulation framework that integrates LLM-based heterogeneous student agents\nwith a self-optimizing teacher agent}. The teacher agent's pedagogical policy\nis dynamically evolved using a genetic algorithm, allowing it to discover and\nrefine effective teaching strategies based on the aggregate performance of\ndiverse learners. In addition, \\textbf{we propose Persona-RAG}, a Retrieval\nAugmented Generation module that enables student agents to retrieve knowledge\ntailored to their individual learning styles. Persona-RAG preserves the\nretrieval accuracy of standard RAG baselines while enhancing personalization,\nan essential factor in modeling realistic educational scenarios. Through\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate how our framework supports the emergence\nof distinct and interpretable teaching patterns when interacting with varied\nstudent populations. Our results highlight the potential of LLM-driven\nsimulations to inform adaptive teaching practices and provide a testbed for\ntraining human educators in controlled, data-driven environments.", "comment": "38 Pages", "journal_ref": null, "primary_category": "cs.AI", "categories": "cs.AI", "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19173v1;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19173v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19173v1"}]
