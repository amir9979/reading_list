Unfortunately,\nexisting screening techniques require expensive and intrusive medical\nprocedures, not globally available, resulting in too many lost would-be-saved\nlives. We present CATCH-FM, CATch Cancer early with Healthcare Foundation\nModels, a cancer pre-screening methodology that identifies high-risk patients\nfor further screening solely based on their historical medical records. With\nmillions of electronic healthcare records (EHR), we establish the scaling law\nof EHR foundation models pretrained on medical code sequences, pretrain\ncompute-optimal foundation models of up to 2.4 billion parameters, and finetune\nthem on clinician-curated cancer risk prediction cohorts. In our retrospective\nevaluation comprising of thirty thousand patients, CATCH-FM achieved strong\nefficacy (60% sensitivity) with low risk (99% specificity and Negative\nPredictive Value), outperforming feature-based tree models as well as general\nand medical large language models by large margins. Despite significant\ndemographic, healthcare system, and EHR coding differences, CATCH-FM achieves\nstate-of-the-art pancreatic cancer risk prediction on the EHRSHOT few-shot\nleaderboard, outperforming EHR foundation models pretrained using on-site\npatient data. Our analysis demonstrates the robustness of CATCH-FM in various\npatient distributions, the benefits of operating in the ICD code space, and its\nability to capture non-trivial cancer risk factors.
