Current approaches often rely on single-modal data,\nlimiting their ability to comprehensively understand complex diseases. To\naddress this, we propose MedTVT-R1, a novel Multimodal Large Language Model\n(MLLM) framework designed to integrate clinical multimodal data for reasoning\nand diagnosing multiple diseases. We construct MedTVT-QA, a curated instruction\ndataset that provides question-answer pairs for physiological-level\ninterpretations and disease-level diagnoses with a Chain of Evidence approach.\nMedTVT-R1 incorporates a modality perception layer to capture inter-modal\ndependencies and adaptively weight modality contributions. Additionally, we\nemploy Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based Reinforcement\nFine-Tuning with a Jaccard Reward function to enhance diagnostic reasoning.\nExperimental results demonstrate MedTVT-R1's superiority in multimodal feature\nutilization and multi-disease diagnosis, offering significant potential for\nclinical applications such as diagnostic report generation and comorbidity\nreasoning.
