To overcome this, we explore zero-shot anomaly detection\nusing Visual Question Answering (VQA) models, which leverage pretrained\nknowledge and textbased prompts to generalize across vision tasks. By\nincorporating prior knowledge of normal battery thermal behavior, we design\nprompts to detect anomalies without battery-specific training data. We evaluate\nthree VQA models (ChatGPT-4o, LLaVa-13b, and BLIP-2) analyzing their robustness\nto prompt variations, repeated trials, and qualitative outputs. Despite the\nlack of finetuning on battery data, our approach demonstrates competitive\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art models that are trained with the\nbattery data.

These methods train a student model to approximate the\nmulti-step denoising process of a pretrained teacher model in a single step,\nenabling one-shot generation. However, theoretical insights into the trade-off\nbetween different distillation strategies and generative quality remain\nlimited, complicating their optimization and selection. In this work, we take a\nfirst step toward addressing this gap. Specifically, we reinterpret trajectory\ndistillation as an operator merging problem in the linear regime, where each\nstep of the teacher model is represented as a linear operator acting on noisy\ndata. These operators admit a clear geometric interpretation as projections and\nrescalings corresponding to the noise schedule. During merging, signal\nshrinkage occurs as a convex combination of operators, arising from both\ndiscretization and limited optimization time of the student model. We propose a\ndynamic programming algorithm to compute the optimal merging strategy that\nmaximally preserves signal fidelity. Additionally, we demonstrate the existence\nof a sharp phase transition in the optimal strategy, governed by data\ncovariance structures. Our findings enhance the theoretical understanding of\ndiffusion trajectory distillation and offer practical insights for improving\ndistillation strategies.", "comment": "31 pages, 19 figures", "journal_ref": null, "primary_category": "cs.LG", "categories": "cs.LG;cs.AI", "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16024v1;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16024v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16024v1"}, {"title": "A Lightweight Self-distillation Network", "link": "https://books.google.com/books%3Fhl%3Den%26lr%3Dlang_en%26id%3DfD5fEQAAQBAJ%26oi%3Dfnd%26pg%3DPA366%26ots%3DUaftC8QyeD%26sig%3Dm_v9g6SiEaHocbaBCUGWOnL6E-c", "details": "J Geng, Q Lan, W Shu, L Xie, H Yang - \u2026 of the First International Conference on \u2026, 2025", "abstract": "for cervical cell classification is developed in this paper.
