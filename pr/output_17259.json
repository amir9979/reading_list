These representations, to varying extents, can be used for\ntasks such as downstream classification, controllable generation, and\ninterpolation. However, the generative performance of DAs relies heavily on how\nwell the latent variables can be modelled and subsequently sampled from. Better\ngenerative modelling is also the primary goal of another class of diffusion\nmodels -- those that learn their forward (noising) process. While effective at\nadjusting the noise process in an input-dependent manner, they must satisfy\nadditional constraints derived from the terminal conditions of the diffusion\nprocess. Here, we draw a connection between these two classes of models and\nshow that certain design decisions (latent variable choice, conditioning\nmethod, etc.) in the DA framework -- leading to a model we term DMZ -- allow us\nto obtain the best of both worlds: effective representations as evaluated on\ndownstream tasks, including domain transfer, as well as more efficient\nmodelling and generation with fewer denoising steps compared to standard DMs.", "comment": "21 pages, 10 tables, 15 figures", "journal_ref": null, "primary_category": "cs.LG", "categories": "cs.LG", "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00136v1;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.00136v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.00136v1"}, {"title": "GCNLA: Inferring Cell-Cell Interactions From Spatial Transcriptomics With Long Short-Term Memory and Graph Convolutional Networks", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11009190/", "details": "C Yang, X Fu, Z Luo, L Wei, J Li, F Cui, Q Zou, Q Zhang\u2026 - IEEE Journal of Biomedical \u2026, 2025", "abstract": "Spatial transcriptomics analysis methods offer an opportunity to investigate highly diverse biological tissues.
