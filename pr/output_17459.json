Inspired by Bloom's Taxonomy, we propose a\nmulti-cognitive-level evaluation framework for assessing LLMs in the medical\ndomain in this study. The framework integrates existing medical datasets and\nintroduces tasks targeting three cognitive levels: preliminary knowledge grasp,\ncomprehensive knowledge application, and scenario-based problem solving. Using\nthis framework, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art general and medical\nLLMs from six prominent families: Llama, Qwen, Gemma, Phi, GPT, and DeepSeek.\nOur findings reveal a significant performance decline as cognitive complexity\nincreases across evaluated models, with model size playing a more critical role\nin performance at higher cognitive levels. Our study highlights the need to\nenhance LLMs' medical capabilities at higher cognitive levels and provides\ninsights for developing LLMs suited to real-world medical applications.", "comment": "20 pages, 11 figures.
