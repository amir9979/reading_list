Cohen", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to extract clinical data\nfrom electronic health records (EHRs), offering significant improvements in\nscalability and efficiency for real-world data (RWD) curation in oncology.\nHowever, the adoption of LLMs introduces new challenges in ensuring the\nreliability, accuracy, and fairness of extracted data, which are essential for\nresearch, regulatory, and clinical applications. Existing quality assurance\nframeworks for RWD and artificial intelligence do not fully address the unique\nerror modes and complexities associated with LLM-extracted data. In this paper,\nwe propose a comprehensive framework for evaluating the quality of clinical\ndata extracted by LLMs. The framework integrates variable-level performance\nbenchmarking against expert human abstraction, automated verification checks\nfor internal consistency and plausibility, and replication analyses comparing\nLLM-extracted data to human-abstracted datasets or external standards. This\nmultidimensional approach enables the identification of variables most in need\nof improvement, systematic detection of latent errors, and confirmation of\ndataset fitness-for-purpose in real-world research. Additionally, the framework\nsupports bias assessment by stratifying metrics across demographic subgroups.\nBy providing a rigorous and transparent method for assessing LLM-extracted RWD,\nthis framework advances industry standards and supports the trustworthy use of\nAI-powered evidence generation in oncology research and practice.", "comment": "18 pages, 3 tables, 1 figure", "journal_ref": null, "primary_category": "cs.LG", "categories": "cs.LG;cs.AI;cs.PF", "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08231v1;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08231v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08231v1"}, {"title": "Feasibility of Automated Precharting using GPT-4 in New Specialty Referrals", "link": "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12150724/", "details": "AS Liang, JM Banda, T Savage, A Pandya, R Carey\u2026 - AMIA Summits on \u2026, 2025", "abstract": "This study evaluates the feasibility of using GPT-4 to automate precharting for specialty referrals, focusing on new patients referred to an otolaryngology clinic for nasal congestion.
