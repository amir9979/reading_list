Zihad Bin Jahangir;Muhammad Ashad Kabir;Sumaiya Akter;Israt Jahan;Minh Chau", "summary": "Automated radiology report generation holds significant potential to reduce\nradiologists' workload and enhance diagnostic accuracy. However, generating\nprecise and clinically meaningful reports from chest radiographs remains\nchallenging due to the complexity of medical language and the need for\ncontextual understanding. Existing models often struggle with maintaining both\naccuracy and contextual relevance. In this paper, we present LLaMA-XR, a novel\nframework that integrates LLaMA 3.1 with DenseNet-121-based image embeddings\nand Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) fine-tuning. LLaMA-XR achieves\nimproved coherence and clinical accuracy while maintaining computational\nefficiency. This efficiency is driven by an optimization strategy that enhances\nparameter utilization and reduces memory overhead, enabling faster report\ngeneration with lower computational resource demands. Extensive experiments\nconducted on the IU X-ray benchmark dataset demonstrate that LLaMA-XR\noutperforms a range of state-of-the-art methods. Our model achieves a ROUGE-L\nscore of 0.433 and a METEOR score of 0.336, establishing new performance\nbenchmarks in the domain. These results underscore LLaMA-XR's potential as an\neffective and efficient AI system for automated radiology reporting, offering\nenhanced clinical utility and reliability.", "comment": "25 pages", "journal_ref": null, "primary_category": "eess.IV", "categories": "eess.IV;cs.AI;cs.CV", "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03178v1;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03178v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03178v1"}]
