Accurate\nestimation of gestational age is critical for monitoring fetal growth, but\ntraditional methods, such as estimation based on the last menstrual period, are\nin some situations difficult to obtain. While ultrasound-based approaches offer\ngreater reliability, they rely on manual measurements that introduce\nvariability. This study presents an interpretable deep learning-based method\nfor automated gestational age calculation, leveraging a novel segmentation\narchitecture and distance maps to overcome dataset limitations and the scarcity\nof segmentation masks. Our approach achieves performance comparable to\nstate-of-the-art models while reducing complexity, making it particularly\nsuitable for resource-constrained settings and with limited annotated data.\nFurthermore, our results demonstrate that the use of distance maps is\nparticularly suitable for estimating femur endpoints.", "comment": "Accepted in Iberian Conference on Pattern Recognition and Image\n  Analysis (IbPRIA) 2025", "journal_ref": null, "primary_category": "eess.IV", "categories": "eess.IV;cs.CV", "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16256v1;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16256v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16256v1"}, {"title": "72091| Treatment Implications of Tricuspid Regurgitation in Patients With Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction", "link": "https://www.structuralheartjournal.org/article/S2474-8706\\(25\\)00102-2/pdf", "details": "M Kitamura, S Roschx, AR Sch\u00f6ber, F Passoke\u2026 - Structural Heart, 2025", "abstract": "Background Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is associated with the worst outcomes among patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).
