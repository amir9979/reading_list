However, most existing vision-language frameworks in the\nmedical domain apply a uniform strategy for local feature extraction,\noverlooking the modality-specific demands. In this work, we present MedMoE, a\nmodular and extensible vision-language processing framework that dynamically\nadapts visual representation based on the diagnostic context. MedMoE\nincorporates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module conditioned on the report type,\nwhich routes multi-scale image features through specialized expert branches\ntrained to capture modality-specific visual semantics. These experts operate\nover feature pyramids derived from a Swin Transformer backbone, enabling\nspatially adaptive attention to clinically relevant regions. This framework\nproduces localized visual representations aligned with textual descriptions,\nwithout requiring modality-specific supervision at inference. Empirical results\non diverse medical benchmarks demonstrate that MedMoE improves alignment and\nretrieval performance across imaging modalities, underscoring the value of\nmodality-specialized visual representations in clinical vision-language\nsystems.", "comment": null, "journal_ref": null, "primary_category": "cs.CV", "categories": "cs.CV", "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08356v2;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08356v2", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08356v2"}, {"title": "VISTA3D: A unified segmentation foundation model for 3D medical imaging", "link": "https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2025/papers/He_VISTA3D_A_Unified_Segmentation_Foundation_Model_For_3D_Medical_Imaging_CVPR_2025_paper.pdf", "details": "Y He, P Guo, Y Tang, A Myronenko, V Nath, Z Xu\u2026 - Proceedings of the \u2026, 2025", "abstract": "Foundation models for interactive segmentation in 2D natural images and videos have sparked significant interest in building 3D foundation models for medical imaging.
