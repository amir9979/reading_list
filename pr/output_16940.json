Current\nhigh-fidelity approaches, especially neural rendering techniques, require\ntime-consuming per-scene optimization, limiting clinical applicability due to\ncomputational demands and poor generalizability. We propose Render-FM, a novel\nfoundation model for direct, real-time volumetric rendering of CT scans.\nRender-FM employs an encoder-decoder architecture that directly regresses 6D\nGaussian Splatting (6DGS) parameters from CT volumes, eliminating per-scan\noptimization through large-scale pre-training on diverse medical data. By\nintegrating robust feature extraction with the expressive power of 6DGS, our\napproach efficiently generates high-quality, real-time interactive 3D\nvisualizations across diverse clinical CT data. Experiments demonstrate that\nRender-FM achieves visual fidelity comparable or superior to specialized\nper-scan methods while drastically reducing preparation time from nearly an\nhour to seconds for a single inference step. This advancement enables seamless\nintegration into real-time surgical planning and diagnostic workflows.
