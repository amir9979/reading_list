In this study, we present an explainable anomaly detection framework\nthat identifies clinically meaningful increases in symptom severity using\nconsumer-grade wearable data. Leveraging data from 2,023 participants with\ndefined healthy baselines, our LSTM autoencoder model learned normal health\npatterns of sleep duration, step count, and resting heart rate. Anomalies were\nflagged when self-reported depression or anxiety scores increased by >=5 points\n(a threshold considered clinically significant). The model achieved an adjusted\nF1-score of 0.80 (precision = 0.73, recall = 0.88) in detecting 393\nsymptom-worsening episodes across 341 participants, with higher performance\nobserved for episodes involving concurrent depression and anxiety escalation\n(F1 = 0.84) and for more pronounced symptom changes (>=10-point increases, F1 =\n0.85). Model interpretability was supported by SHAP-based analysis, which\nidentified resting heart rate as the most influential feature in 71.4\npercentage of detected anomalies, followed by physical activity and sleep.\nTogether, our findings highlight the potential of explainable anomaly detection\nto enable personalized, scalable, and proactive mental health monitoring in\nreal-world settings.", "comment": null, "journal_ref": null, "primary_category": "cs.CV", "categories": "cs.CV;stat.AP", "links": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03039v1;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03039v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03039v1"}, {"title": "Identifying Patient Satisfaction from Electronic Health Record Data-A Retrospective Register Study", "link": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40380425/", "details": "H von Gerich, V Kyt\u00f6, M Medvecky, J Walsh\u2026 - Studies in health technology \u2026, 2025", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to review the potential of electronic health record (EHR) data to automatically identify key concepts related to patient satisfaction in cardiac care.
