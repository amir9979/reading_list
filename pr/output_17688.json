We experiment on IU-xray dataset, which exhibits the\naforementioned criteria, and evaluate BiomedCLIP in classifying images\n(radiographs) in three contexts: zero-shot inference, full finetuning, and\nlinear probing. The results show that the model under zero-shot settings\nover-predicts all labels, leading to poor precision and inter-class\nseparability. Full fine-tuning improves classification of distinct diseases,\nwhile linear probing detects overlapping features. We demonstrate visual\nunderstanding of the model using Grad-CAM heatmaps and compare with 15\nannotations by a radiologist. We highlight the need for careful adaptations of\nthe models to foster reliability and applicability in a real-world setting.
