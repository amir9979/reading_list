% Review of similar datasets and why this is different. Several question-answering benchmarks have been used to assess the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs; however, these are limited to a single correct answer~. %With the recent advancements of LLMs, there have been many recently created new text datasets for multiple new problem types.  Currently, the most common way LLMs are currently evaluated is by multiple choice question and answering; however, these are limited to having a single correct answer % rather~.% In the medical domain, datasets such as MedQA~ and MedMCQA~ have also been used to assess basic medical competence.  Our problem differs %from these  by having multiple correct answers that depend on a set of attributes, which is similar to how demographic information might influence public opinion in the OpinionQA dataset~. %For example, if a person is selfish they would choose to help themselves while an altruistic person would choose to help others.   Due to the inclusion of several moral DMAs in our dataset (e.g. fairness), our work is also closely related to datasets designed to assess moral values, such as ETHICS~, MoralChoice~, and MoCA~.

% Chain of thought, self-consistency, in-context learning Prompt engineering methods leverage the few-shot learning capabilities of LLMs~, avoiding the need to retrain or fine-tune models, which can be expensive and time-consuming. This approach can be particularly effective in data-limited domains, such as medicine~. %Recent research into low-data environment learning is focused on prompt engineering to improve the prompt given to the LLM rather than retraining since there isn't enough data to effectively fine-tune into these environments~ (such as medical triage).  % One common prompt engineering strategy is based on in-context learning (ICL), which  %can significantly increase model performance on different tasks.  ICL  provides other task examples as part of the prompt, enabling the LLM to learn from few-shot data without directly training on them~.  %This has been enhanced by using examples similar to the exact problem the LLM is trying to solve~.

Another common prompt engineering method is using chain-of-thought (COT) to break down %an answer in the  ICL examples into simpler, intermediate reasoning steps which the LLM can follow when generating its outputs %copy to improve the accuracy of solution significantly ~.  The reasoning traces used for COT can be hand-crafted for specific problems such as medical question-answering~ or even generated synthetically by another LLM~. Self-consistency extends this approach by sampling model outputs multiple times and taking a simple majority vote to determine the final answer~. % Our work builds upon these approaches by incorporating DMA information directly into the prompt, which helps to both ground and steer the model's outputs based on specific attributes. %differs from this prompt engineering by adding the addition condition of having attributes that alone can change the answer depending on which attributes are strongly favored.% This also provides a certain level of explainability, %Related to this particular approach is the aspect of model explainability, % by giving additional insight into the model's reasoning process when making a decision. The explanation for a particular decision can be displayed to an end user for evaluating the model and establishing appropriate levels of trust in the system. Although there are clear caveats with LLM-generated explanations~, we found that conditioning the model output's on a generated explanation prior to its answer choice generally improved performance (see Sec.~). %For our current approach,% When using self-consistency, we randomly sampled a given explanation corresponding to the selected answer, although more sophisticated techniques such as employing a LLM summarization module~ over multiple generated explanations could be employed in the future.% !!!Other methods using RAG to improve prompts% Given the limited amount of data, our approach cannot utilize fine-tuning approaches~ either from additional in-domain data or from human responses such as RLHF/DPO~.  ALIGN builds off of other prompt engineering work that focuses on changing the input prompt rather than retraining the model~.  % RLHF, Fine-grained RLHF, aligning to different personas% RLHF, Constitutional AI, SteerLM, etc.% Introduce RLHF here% RLHF, fine-grained RLHF, SteerLM

Standard LLM alignment approaches like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) train a reward model on human preference data~, which provides a relatively coarse signal for shaping model outputs (e.g. to produce helpful, honest, and harmless content). More recent works use finer-grained reward signals, which can also provide additional control of LLM outputs at test time~.

Our work is most closely related to a line of research on persona-based alignment% for LLMs ~. Using the OpinionQA dataset~, prompts describing specific personas were used to steer LLMs toward opinions representative of different demographic groups. % which seeks to change model outputs by describing a specific persona the model should adapt to. %% Santurkar~et al.~ created the OpinionQA dataset based on PEW opinion surveys to study the representativeness, steerability, and consistency of LLMs while defining alignment metrics to understand how well an LLM can align to multiple correct choices.  % LLMs were aligned on three persona-based prompts to steer the model toward certain answers as well as no persona to see which demographics the LLM answers correspond.  Hwang~et al.~%examine OpinionQA and  expanded on this approach and incorporated %.  The OpinionQA data shows that opinions differ between people with the same demography or ideology as well as across the topic.  To combat these issues,  additional alignment information in the form of user-specific ideology, demography, and opinions that led to better alignment scores. Our approach is also related to recent work on measuring the alignment between humans and LLMs on different causal and moral judgment tasks~.

% While our approach does not preclude the use of proprietary language models (e.g. OpenAI's GPT-3.4/4 models~), here  In our context, unaligned decisions refer to the choices made by an LLM before alignment to a particular DMA (see Sec.~ with details of our aligned decision-making approach). Conceptually, this is similar to prior work characterizing the default opinions of LLMs using survey questions~. Our approach uses open-source LLMs whose weights are readily available; however, our open-source software framework can also be used with other models. %This is done mainly for two reasons: 1) these models are often available in different sizes (e.g. 7B, 13B, etc.), which enables different size-performance trade-offs, and 2) these models can be more easily customized for different applications (e.g. either using quantization, additional fine-tuning, etc.) %We explored several different types of models, including instruction-tuned models~ and chat models, which are trained via reinforcement learning from human feedback or RLHF~.  For our experiments, we used the Falcon 7B~ and Mistral 7B~ instruction-tuned models, and the Llama 2 7B and 13B chat models~ with default settings from Huggingface. %All model weights were accessed from Huggingface with default %prompt and inference %settings.% Anything else standard here to say about tokenization/quantization?% Given a scenario, we prompt the model to respond with the index of its choice, conditioned on its reasoning using a -structured output format (see Appendix~ for more details and the prompts used). We observed that this produced qualitatively better reasoning traces, similar to chain-of-thought~.

%Language model % Alignment techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback provide a relatively coarse %and static% reward signal for shaping model outputs~. % (e.g. to produce helpful, honest, and harmless responses)~.%% In contrast,  Decision-making scenarios are often dynamic and we control %may result in situations where there is no correct answer, and in these cases,  alignment by grounding the LLM's decisions on %in a %more %fine-grained manner by using  different sets of DMAs. % that might only be known at test time. %This enables customizable profiles (e.g. risk-seeking vs. risk-averse decision-making), which can also be easily adjusted at test-time without the need for additional retraining. This allows the model to potentially be aligned to many target attribute values (e.g. high fairness and low risk aversion), which can be used to easily customize model decision-making at test time.

Due to the lack of alignment data in the medical triage domain, %For the particular domain of medical triage (and many other domains as well), there is very little alignment data that can be used for training.%As a result, standard alignment techniques such as RLHF or even parameter-efficient fine-tuning may not be appropriate. Given the data scarcity, %As a result, we focused primarily on prompt-based alignment techniques leveraging the zero-shot %, in-context  learning abilities of LLMs~. %Our work is most closely related to a line of research in persona-based alignment~, which seeks to change model outputs by describing a specific persona the model should adapt in its outputs. For each of the DMAs described in Sec.~, we created a prompt that defines that particular attribute and describes how that attribute is expressed at either the high or low levels (see Fig.~, and  Appendix~ for the detailed prompts). These prompts were included as part of the system message. %For instruction-tuned models, this prompt was included prior to the scenario context. For chat-based models, this prompt was included as part of the system message. %This intuitively changes the model's outputs to focus on this particular attribute. This description can easily be encoded as part of the prompt or system message, which can be used to modulate the outputs of a particular model. An example of this prompt for the "X" attribute is shown in Y. Our unaligned system does not contain this description, and is considered the model's implicit ability to answer a particular question. %We note that this particular approach could be extended to enable few-shot or in-context learning, but we did not explore this in the current work.% Additional plots to go into appendix LLM outputs are stochastic, generating varying outputs, which can be detrimental to the quantified analysis and system stability. % but their reproducibility can be somewhat controlled by the temperature sampling parameter~.  We leverage recent work on self-consistency~, %,chan2023ic},  which has been shown to improve model performance on different tasks.  %For this particular approach, multiple model outputs are sampled (along with their reasoning traces), and a simple majority vote can be used to determine the final answer.% We extend this approach to include both positive and negative samples to compute a weighted self-consistency. For a given question and attribute, we sample multiple outputs for the high and low attribute %alignment  prompts, which generate both positive and negative samples (relative to the target attribute value). For example, if aligning to the high fairness, we put a positive weight on choices selected using the high fairness %alignment  prompt, and a negative weight on choices selected using the low fairness.  %alignment % prompt %(and vice versa if the target attribute was low fairness).  We used temperature sampling~ with a value of  to generate a total of five positive and five negative responses for each scenario in our dataset.

When using self-consistency, we randomly sampled a reasoning trace %given explanation  corresponding to the selected answer, although more sophisticated techniques such as employing an LLM summarization module~ over multiple traces could be used in the future. Reasoning traces can serve as a useful form of model  explanation,  % This also provides a certain level of explainability, %Related to this particular approach is the aspect of model explainability, % by giving  providing additional insight into the model's reasoning process when making a decision.

For our current approach, we randomly choose the given explanation corresponding to the selected answer, although more sophisticated techniques such as employing a LLM summarization module~ over multiple generated explanations could potentially be used.% Describe implicit alignment of different models We first investigated the implicit decision-making tendencies of different models, which corresponds to the unaligned %model configuration. These models performed similarly, % across attributes,  but we observed %some  asymmetries in alignment  accuracy to %the  high vs. low attributes (e.g. 60.6\% vs. 39.4\% %to the high versus low attributes levels  for %the  Falcon-7B), % model),  suggesting models may be more %implicitly aligned to certain attribute values.  % Interestingly, across all models tested, alignment with weighted self-consistency seemed to yield greater improvement (in alignment accuracy) for the low target attribute values. One hypothesis is that, generally, the implicit decision-making tendencies of the LLMs (in the unaligned configuration) might be more closely aligned with the high target attribute values than the low values.  % which limited the effect of additional alignment techniques.

For %the % Llama 2 13B, % model, % use of the zero-shot alignment prompt and weighted self-consistency greatly improved %alignment % accuracy  (e.g. 50.6\%  76.1\%  86.4\% for the low attributes). % level). % Aligning %The aligned % Llama 2 7B and Mistral %models also showed % improved performance over the unaligned %model % configuration.  In contrast, %the  Falcon-7B %model  showed mixed results, where %alignment  accuracy sometimes decreased when using zero-shot prompting and self-consistency (e.g. for alignment to high target attribute values). Although speculative, this may be due to slight differences in how system messages (which we used for alignment) are encoded in the Falcon-7B model, relative to the Llama-7B and Mistral-7B models. % Overall, the inferior performance of Falcon-7B is consistent with reported results on other benchmarks. our experience with other related datasets.%No one model aligned well with all attributes, although we found that moral attributes such as fairness and utilitarianism were harder to align to compared to domain-specific attributes like protocol focus and continuing care, when comparing top-5 model accuracies (see Appendix~). No one model aligned well with all attributes, although we found that utilitarianism and risk aversion were harder to align to while protocol focus and continuing care were easier to align to, when comparing top-5 model accuracies (see Appendix~). The radar plots in Figs.~ and~, and more in Appendix~, provide insights into the decision-making tendencies of different models for each DMA value. For attributes with a smaller amount of test data (protocol focus, fairness, and risk aversion) the results may be less reliable, e.g. for high risk aversion self-consistency did not help, and for high protocol focus three configurations achieved a perfect score.

% % Comment on differences in base model, e.g. just pretraining vs. SFT (Falcon-Instruct) vs. RLHF (Llama) We also studied the effect of different training techniques on alignment accuracy, comparing instruction-tuned models~ and models trained via RLHF~. %Specifically, we considered instruction fine-tuning (which is a form of supervised fine-tuning) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which is commonly used to train chat models~. We found that the Llama 2 models trained via RLHF were generally more alignable than Falcon-7B, both overall and for individual attributes. %This trend held even at the same model size (e.g. comparing Falcon-7B-Instruct and Llama2-7B-Chat).  Interestingly, we found that Mistral-7B also achieved high alignment accuracy, even though it was not trained with RLHF.

In contrast, we did find a benefit when including negative samples, particularly when using more than one negative sample. %A set of ablation studies also showed that increasing the number of samples and using both positive and negative samples helped improve the overall alignment (see Table~).

A scenario is presented to the model to produce an unaligned decision, which provides a measure of the model's implicit decision-making tendencies. To align the model to a particular DMA (e.g. fairness shown here), we use a zero-shot alignment prompt as well as a form of weighted self-consistency. Weighted self-consistency samples the model multiple times using both high and low attribute prompts, and then majority weights the chosen answers based on the target attribute value (e.g. positive weight for high fairness answers and negative weight for low fairness answers when aligning to high fairness). Self-consistency also produces reasoning traces that are used as a form of explanation.   -10ptfig:align-systemMoral desertAlicke2000Utilitarianismkahane2018beyond,greene2014beyondApproachsec:approachfig:align-systemLLMs as Unaligned Decision-Makerssec:unalignedsec:alignedsanturkar2023whosealmazrouei2023falconjiang2023mistraltouvron2023llamajsonsec:promptswei2022chainAlignment to Decision-Maker Attributessec:alignedopenai2023gptsec:datasetfig:align-systemsec:prompts%tiiuae_falcon-7b-instruct.pdf}% across individual DMAs (both high and low levels).
