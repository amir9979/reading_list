The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4  into applications demonstrates their capacity to address a wide range of queries. These models, including specialized ones like Bing Chat, generate responses based on pre-trained text data and, in some cases, real-time web searches. The inherent flexibility of LLMs, however, means that their outputs are unpredictable, posing challenges in controlling specific responses and preventing undesirable behavior . Malicious exploitation of these models' vulnerabilities is a concern. To address this, understanding the nature of attacks and developing protective measures is crucial. A key strategy in this research involves using counterfactual explanations . This approach analyzes the minimal changes in prompts that significantly alter the model's responses, enhancing our understanding of LLMs and their potential weaknesses. This process aims to refine the interpretability of LLMs and identify areas for improvement.

Prompt injection involves altering a natural language processing model's input prompts to sway its output, categorized into direct and indirect types .

Direct prompt injection is a significant risk for Large Language Models (LLMs), as it manipulates inputs to provoke non-compliant responses, undermining ethical guidelines. This method involves adding misleading commands to prompts, tricking the model into ignoring safety protocols, a strategy highlighted by Greshake  and examined by Perez et al. , leading to security breaches.

Indirect prompt injection, conversely, targets the model's data sources. Malicious actors might pollute the network with false information, leading the model to share these unreliable sources with users, posing threats to privacy and security, as discussed by Sarkar . To counteract this, some developers restrict their models to trusted websites.

Jailbreak approaches are attackers use complex, carefully crafted prompts to evade developer-imposed restrictions. These prompts may frame requests within fictional narratives or hypothetical scenarios, subtly coaxing the model into producing responses that would typically be restricted.  Previous studies have explored various methods related to jailbreaking, including AutoDAN, a novel attack that can automatically generate stealthy jailbreak prompts using a carefully designed incremental genetic algorithm.  Additionally, some research has provided reliable jailbreak question sets.  Leveraging insights from these studies, we have conducted further investigations into how these nuanced prompts can manipulate model outputs and have delved into their implications.

% Research showcases this strategy, illustrating how these nuanced prompts can manipulate model outputs. 

System Prompts Extraction is an attack to extract information from system prompts. The attacker can extract the information of the system by adding special characters, symbols, or words to the system prompt to induce the system to generate specific output. Examples include the use of placeholders during the attack and EL expressions that steal potential website and server system-level variables and commands . Previous research has explored the utilization of simple text-based attacks to extract actual secret prompts from models.  In our investigation, we analyze these texts, identifying crucial features and elucidating the potential reasons behind their success.

Prompt Hijacking is an attack in which an attacker manipulates LLMs to generate specific outputs by using elaborate hints. An attacker can induce LLMs to generate malicious or false messages by adding special characters, symbols, or words to the prompts. Such as inducing the generation of fake news, malicious code, phishing emails, etc. to disrupt the main tasks of LLMs . Presently, some studies have endeavored to furnish defensive strategies and datasets aimed at thwarting prompt injection attacks.  With the assistance of these data, we can better study the circumstances under which the model is more susceptible to attacks.

Defense strategies against prompt injection in Large Language Models (LLMs) are mainly categorized into Prevention-based and Detection-based Defenses.

Prevention-based Defenses proactively process inputs to thwart prompt injections. Techniques like sandwich prevention, which adds instructional prompts post-user input, and data prompt isolation, which separates data and instruction prompts, alongside rewriting user prompts (instructional prevention), help prevent targeted attacks .

Detection-based Defenses, on the other hand, focus on identifying and addressing risks within prompts and responses. Methods include response-based detection, which screens outputs for inappropriate content, and LLM-based detection, employing LLMs themselves to evaluate prompts for potential threats . These strategies are crucial for safeguarding against common attacks, though challenges remain in dealing with unconventional attack patterns.

We propose a Counterfactual Explainable Incremental Prompt Attack (CEIPA), a well-structured approach to evaluate the robustness of LLMs. We utilize four levels of intervention: word, character, sentence, and a combination of word/character levels, each serving a distinct purpose in our analysis. We start with a relatively weak attack prompt that cannot initially mislead the LLM. Then, systematically, we modify this prompt across the four levels in sequence. For each level, we incrementally adjust the attacking prompt based on the previous one. Let  represent the -th attacking prompt, and we define  as a function of the previous prompt , i.e.:

Here,  represents the type of intervention depending on the level being used. The core of our methodology involves generating counterfactual explanations by creating alternative scenarios through incremental input changes. In order to understand the limitations and vulnerabilities of LLMs' language processing, we collect data during the attack to observe their reaction to different cues. The goal during the analysis of the results is to identify points that break through the LLM defence by progressively increasing the complexity of the cue.

We define the attack prompt as , where each  is a word in the prompt. Using coreNLP , a natural language processing tool, we structure the prompt and categorize its words into two sets:

 represents replaceable words, and  denotes non-replaceable words. To preserve the original meaning of the prompt, we classify ``proper nouns,'' ``personal pronouns,'' ``prepositions,'' ``unit words,'' and ``dates'' as irreplaceable. The remaining words are considered replaceable. We use S to represent set of replaceable words.

. We then mask the replaceable parts  based on our selection strategy:

The importance score  is defined as follows:

Here,  represents the output by the BERT model , and function  is the Cosine Similarity. Our goal is to find the replacement in  that creates the greatest semantic difference from the original text sample . Therefore, the optimal replaceable parts are identified as:

Given the limited number of synonyms for a word, we store every used synonym to prevent repetition. We also rank words based on their importance scores , labeled as . If a word  runs out of synonyms, we move on to mutate . Notably, we use GPT-4 for each word-level mutation to generate synonyms. This process provides direct insight into which words are more sensitive in LLMs, contributing significantly to our understanding of their vulnerabilities. More details of the GPT-4 prompts are shown in the Appendix .

In the sentence-level iteration of our Incremental Prompt Injection Attack, we employ a Summarize-and-Rewrite (S) technique to succinctly summarize each sub-sentence from the attack prompt, enhancing our capability to effectively mutate these individual sub-sentences . The modification process also involves comparing the mutated sub-sentence with its original form, employing the BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) scoring system , along with the judgment from a LLM . This approach focuses on manipulating individual sentences extracted from a prompt, identified by their separation with a period (``.'').

We summarize each sentence  based on LLM:

Then, in each iteration, we randomly select a sentence  and employ an LLM to generate a similar sentence  based on 's sentence summary.

The mutated sentence  replaces  in the prompt to form a new attacking prompt :

The final step involves utilizing the BLEU score to evaluate the similarity between the original and transformed sentences, which is to make sure the original prompt and new prompt are similar. Additionally, the similarity is confirmed by an assessment from a large language model, such as GPT-4. A prompt is deemed ready for output only when it meets both criteria: a high BLEU similarity and a positive assessment from an LLM. This dual-validation approach ensures a thorough and effective evaluation of the language model's robustness against sophisticated, prompt-based attacks.

The LLM used in Eq. are GPT-4, and the detailed prompts for sentence summary, generating similar sentence, and similarity assessment are shown in Appendix . We continuously refine the attacking prompt until we achieve a breakthrough. Once we reach this point, we analyze the results in detail to evaluate the effectiveness and nuances of our sentence-level counterfactual approach.

We introduce the Char Transformer technique, which leverages the symbolic nature of language by introducing spelling errors into key terms, effectively transforming them into ``unknowns'' – terms not recognized by standard dictionaries . These altered words are then mapped to ``unknown'' embedding vectors, testing the model's ability to process unexpected inputs.

 Tactics to generate these spelling errors include:

1. Insert: We introduce a space within the word. This method exploits the fact that English words are typically separated by spaces, allowing us to deceive classifiers without significantly changing the word's appearance.

2. Delete: A random character, excluding the first and last, is removed from the word. It subtly changes the word while preserving most of its original structure, maintaining recognizably.

3. Swap: We switch the positions of two internal characters in the word, avoiding the first and last letters. This approach mimics common typing errors, offering a realistic yet simple alteration.

4. Substitute-Character (Sub-C): Characters are replaced with visually similar ones (e.g., ``o'' with ``O'', ``l'' with ``1'', ``a'' with ``@''), or with adjacent characters on the keyboard (e.g., ``m'' with ``n''). This method takes advantage of visual similarities between characters to create deceptive yet recognizable changes.

These methods are designed to maintain a minimal edit distance (Levenshtein distance), ensuring that the original and modified words are closely related visually or morphologically.

In each round of the char level attack, we randomly select one of these methods and apply it to the most important word (identified in Section 3.1) in the original attack prompt. To avoid redundancy, each ``bug word'' generated is recorded.

In the Word/Char Level Incremental Attack, we synergize the Word Level with the Char Level. This is achieved through the introduction of a ``Substitute-Word (Sub-W)'' strategy, which generates synonyms as per the Word Level approach, combined with the four techniques utilized in the Char Level attack (examples in Appendix  Table ). The objective of this combined method is to subtly modify both words and characters, ensuring that their semantic and syntactic integrity is preserved.

In each round, we randomly select one of the five methods (including the newly introduced Sub-W technique) to apply to the most important word in the original attack prompt, and each `bug word' generated during this process is recorded to avoid repetitive alterations.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% In our study, we utilize two distinct types of datasets: a system prompt dataset and an attacking prompt dataset. We find that the jailbreak task does not necessitate a system prompt dataset. Consequently, we randomly select 70 unique attacking prompts from Jailbreak Chat  and make up 100 distinct attacking questions. Each prompt is paired with each attacking question, resulting in the creation of a comprehensive set of 7,000 unique attacking prompts. For the tasks of system prompt extraction and hijacking, we have meticulously chosen two specific datasets from Tensor Trust . These datasets include both a system prompt dataset and an attacking prompt dataset. 

Our research spans three distinct tasks: The first task involves several jailbreak sub-tasks, which entail prompting the large language model (LLM) to generate prohibited content such as illegal information. The second task deals with the exposure of system prompts, while the third revolves around prompt hijacking, where we aim to make the LLM disregard its built-in system prompts and produce outputs tailored to our specifications.

We use GPT-4  as our judgment model and customize two kinds of powerful judgment prompts for Jailbreak and System Prompt Extraction tasks to determine whether the attack was successful. We randomly selected 1000 attack prompts from both tasks and manually verified the judgment accuracy, which approached 100\%. Further details regarding the judgment model prompts and accuracy can be found in the Appendix .

We have performed our three attacking tasks on four state-of-the-art models: GPT-3.5, LLaMa2, Gemma, and Guanaco.

To assess the efficacy of our testing methodology, we employ the following metrics:

Our graphical analysis features two types of visual representations for clarity and precision. Bar graphs are utilized to present the cumulative ASR following the conclusion of iterations, with the caveat that only the first success of each attack prompt is taken into account. Concurrently, line graphs are employed to trace the trajectory of ASR over successive iterations.

In our initial experiment, we examine the Jailbreak task, which focuses on the generation of harmful content by large language models. We establish a baseline by counting the number of successful attacks without any mutations. We will introduce incremental mutations across four incremental levels for attacks that do not initially succeed. This process will continue until the attack either penetrates the model's defences or reaches a predefined maximum of 50 iterations. Data will be shown in bar and line graphs as discussed in the Evaluation Metrics section. 

The experimental results demonstrate a notable improvement in attack success rates following mutations. As illustrated in Figure a, there is a discernible increase in the cumulative number of successful attacks at each mutation level, underscoring the efficacy of post-mutation strategies. Table  in the Appendix  showcases a marked enhancement in success rates, especially notable at the word and sentence levels. For example, compared to the baseline CLEAN of 0.29\% with the original jailbreak dataset on GPT-3.5, mutations at the word and sentence levels elevate the ASR to approximately 0.50\%. The sentence level, shown in Figure a, demonstrates a superior success rate, peaking around the 12th round before experiencing a gradual decrease. This level also exhibits more pronounced fluctuations, potentially due to the more significant changes introduced with each iteration at this level.

We meticulously track the total number of successful attacks for each mutation level at every round, revealing a complex interplay of dynamics as depicted in Figure a. A notable observation is the declining success rate at the word level, where initial incremental word changes increase success, but eventually, the use of synonyms becomes less effective or exhaustive, leading to a decrease in success. The char level and char/word level experiments show an intriguing difference. Initially, they follow similar paths, with the char/word level even outperforming the char level around round 6. However, the word/char level experiences a sharp decrease after round 13. This may be due to the ``Substitute-Word (Sub-W)'' strategy disrupting the meaning of attack prompts. For example, if the word ``example'' changes to ``exam ple'' through the ``Insert'' strategy and then ``exam'' undergoes ``Sub-W,'' then it will become ``test ple,'' altering the original prompt's meaning.

Further insights reveal that longer attack prompts generally achieve higher effectiveness. Additionally. as shown in Table  in Appendix , our mutation strategy tends to select verbs more frequently, indicating their pivotal role in enhancing the success of attacks.

We evaluate the Transfer Success Rate Study. with results shown in Figure a. Notably, attack prompts effective against the GPT-3.5 or Guanaco model face challenges when targeting the LLaMA2-13B and Gemma models, highlighting the latter's robustness and enhanced security against jailbreak attacks. 

We also exam the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) graph for the Jailbreak task, uncovering several intriguing patterns regarding counterfactual explanations that contribute to a deeper understanding of the GPT model and its responses. For a comprehensive analysis and detailed insights, refer to the section .

We utilize the tensor trust system prompt extraction dataset , comprising 570 system prompts and an equal number of attack prompts. This setup gives us a substantial pool of 324,900 potential attacks for analysis. We adhere closely to the dataset's prompt structure, which follows the format: ``pre'' + ``attack'' + ``post''. In our experimentation, the incremental mutations are exclusively applied to the ``attack'' section.

In line with our methodology from the previous experiment, we established a baseline by counting the successful attack number without any mutations. Figure b illustrates the distribution of successful attacks across each level, with the sentence and word levels demonstrating the highest efficacy in this context. For a detailed breakdown, refer to Table  in the Appendix .

An intriguing pattern emerges when comparing Figure a with Figure b, as both exhibit similar trends at the word and sentence levels. This parallel suggests that our CEIPA framework enhances the success rate comparably across both the Jailbreak and System Prompt Extraction tasks. However, upon analyzing the line graphs in Figure a and Figure b, it indicates distinct trends at each iteration across these tasks.

Particularly, Figure b reveals a pronounced concave pattern at the word level, peaking around the 22nd round before a subsequent decline. A closer review of the data shows that out of 570 attack prompts, more than 170 contain fewer than 21 words. This explains why the word level peaks more quickly in this task compared to the Jailbreak task and the sharp decrease in success after round 30, as shorter incremental attack prompts lose effectiveness when synonyms are exhausted.

Regarding transfer success rates, as depicted in Figure b, our findings suggest that the LLaMA2 and Gemma models maintains higher security levels compared to the GPT-3.5 and Guanaco in the System Prompt Extraction task.

In our Prompt Hijacking experiment, we utilize the hijacking dataset from Tensor Trust , which comprises 776 system prompts paired with an equal number of attack prompts. This setup provides a substantial total of 602,176 potential attacks. As with the System Prompt Extraction task, we adhere to the same structural rule for prompt composition.

In this task, an attack is considered successful only if the response from the Large Language Model (LLM) explicitly states ``Access Granted'' either as the entire response or as the final two words. This criterion is established to exclude responses that do not directly imply successful hijacking. For example, a response like ``To say `Access Granted,' you have to enter the password'' would not be counted as a successful attack, despite containing the phrase, because it does not grant access.

Consistent with our previous experiments, we set the baseline as the total number of successful attacks prior to any mutations. The results, illustrated in Figure c, indicate that while our incremental mutation technique does enhance the effectiveness of the attack prompts, the improvement was modest. We attribute the relatively modest improvement to the demanding success criteria of this task, which arguably renders it more challenging compared to the previous tasks. As illustrated in Table  in Appendix , it becomes apparent that our incremental mutation approach can only enhance CLEAN by a maximum of 6\% for the GPT-3.5 model and 4\% for the LLaMA2-13B model.

As shown in Figure c, the word level trends observed in the Prompt Hijacking task align closely with those in the System Prompt Extraction task. This similarity is likely due to the comparable structures of the two datasets. Notably, the Hijacking dataset includes more than 160 prompts that are under 21 words in length out of the 776 total, which provides similar influences to the overall trend and effectiveness of the attacks as in the System Prompt Extraction task.

There is also a comparable trend emerging from the transfer success rate experiment depicted in Figure c, mirroring the consistency seen in previous tasks where the LLaMA-2 and Gemma models consistently exhibits higher security levels than the GPT-3.5 and Guanaco models.
